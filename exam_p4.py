'One of the things I learned so far in this class that I felt was cool was coding an AI. I had the opportuntiy to do this when making the nim game. I was able to create the entire decison making process for the computer. It made me thnk about the small decisons that made to be deiced upon within every process and understand all the details. I was forced to take complicated decisions and break them down to smaller decisons that I can write in the form of an if statement. The constuction of the decison making process also forced me to be an architect and understand what will be required for the AI to function properly. When I was done coding I was able to interact with the AI and watch it seemless go through the process which I designed.
